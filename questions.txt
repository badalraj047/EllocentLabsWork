Question 1:									(Time: 15 mins)
Given a list of meeting time intervals, where each interval has a start time and an end time, find the minimum number of meeting rooms required so that no meetings overlap.
Example
Input
[(0, 30), (5, 10), (15, 20)]

Question 1: Todo Manager (State Management + OOP)                           
(Time: 40 mins)      
Create a TodoManager class to manage tasks internally.
Each task should have: { id, title, completed }
Requirements:
Implement the following methods:
addTask(title) → adds a new task


removeTask(id) → deletes task by id


toggleComplete(id) → marks complete/incomplete


listCompleted() → returns completed tasks


listPending() → returns pending tasks


Notes:
IDs must be unique
Store tasks inside the class (no globals)
Return updated results where appropriate
Question 2: Shopping Cart System (Objects + Business Logic)                                                                    (Time: 1 hour)
Build a simple shopping cart.
Requirements:
Implement functions:
addItem(product, price, quantity)


removeItem(product)


updateQuantity(product, quantity)


getSubtotal()


applyDiscount(code)


getTotal()


Rules:
Tax = 10%


SAVE10 → 10% discount


SAVE20 → 20% discount


Notes:
Handle invalid inputs


Prevent negative quantities


Return the final payable amount.
